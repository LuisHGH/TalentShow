Nanis is a brazilian programmer who likes to freelance for his teachers. Using all of his free time and good will, Nanis charges nothing for his services and gets nothing in return. This project is what he and I, Diegovsky, made (mostly me) in about 4 hours for our english teacher. It registers teams and participants, then prints which team has the best score.
